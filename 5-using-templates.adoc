### Using Templates

:data-uri:

In this lab exercise we will learn how to use OpenShift Web Console to
spin up a MySQL database using templates. We will then add a frontend
PHP application that accesses this database using the service exposed by
the database. We will provide a route (a URL) to access the frontend
application from a browser.

*Step 1: Create a Project*

Based on the experience gained from the previous exercise, log into the
OpenShift Web Console. You will see the list of Projects.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

Using the *New Project* button, create a new project. We will call it
*consoleproject-userxx*.
Type in a *Display Name* and *Description* of your choice.

Press the *Create* button to complete the project creation from the Web
Console. This will accomplish the same job as `oc new-project` from CLI.

*Step 2: Create a MYSQL database using the template*

Click on *Add to Project* button and you will be taken to select an
image or template. You will see the application create screen as shown
below:

image::application_create_screen.png[image]

Scroll down and click on *Data Stores* session. Find *MySQL (Ephemeral)*
template from the list and click *Select*. You will also notice *MySQL
(Persistent)* template. But we will address that in a different lab
exercise.

image::mysql_ephemeral_template.png[MySQL Template,300,align="center"]

You will be taken to the mysql ephemeral creation screen. Click edit
parameters and edit the values to use the following values:

----
Database Service Name: mysql
MySQL Connection Username: mysqluser
MySQL Connection Password: supersecret
MySQL Database Name: sample
----
 

Click the *Create* button.

Click *Go to overview*.

It will take you back to the project overview page and soon you will see
an image of a running pod.

image::mysql_pod_on_proj_overview.png[image]

If pod does not show running, Click *Applications* and select
*Deployments*, do the following:

1.  Click onto `mysql` deployments config
2.  Click on the *Actions* button and select *Edit Health Checks*
3.  Under the Readiness Probe section remove the single quotes around
`$MYSQL_PASSWORD`.
4.  Click *Save*
5.  Click *Applications* and select *Pods*
6.  Click onto the pod name
7.  Click on the *Actions* button and select *Delete*

Browse over to Pods, Services and Deployments from the *Applications*
tab to notice the additions to the project. You will note that the
service has been assigned an IP address that starts with `172.*`. Make a
note of that. Also note the port that is exposed by this service. By
default it exposes `3306`.

*Step 3: Add data to MySQL database*

Let us see how we can enter the pod and access the database.

From the command line, change the project to the
`consoleproject-userxx` using the following command:

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

----
$ oc project consoleproject-userxx
----

Based on what you learned previously get the list of running pods by running:

----
$ oc get pods
----

You will find one pod for mysql running. Take a note of it's name.

Enter the pod by running the following command. Substitute the pod name
with your mysql pod name.

----
$ oc rsh mysql-1-aewve

bash-4.2$
----

You will be taken to a bash prompt inside the running pod. Now using the
service ip address you noted earlier, port number, username and password
you used start the mysql client as shown below. You will have to
substitute your values here.

TIP: If you need service ip address navigate to *Applications->Services* tab on the Web Console.

[source,sh]
----
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -umysqluser -psupersecret
----

You will be taken to the `mysql` prompt. See the list of databases. You
will notice that the sample database that you requested is added and
available.

[source,sh]
----
mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| sample             |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
----

Change over to use the `sample` database.

[source,sh]
----
mysql> use sample;
Database changed
----

Now `show tables` shows an empty set. So let us create a table and add
some records using the commands shown below.

Create the table:

[source,sql]
----
create table users (user_id int not null auto_increment, username varchar(200),PRIMARY KEY(user_id));
----

Now we add some data:

[source,sql]
----
insert into users values (null, 'joe');
insert into users values (null, 'alice');
----

Verify that the records you added are there:

[source,sql]
----
select * from users;
----

Now `exit` MySQL client and `exit` out of the pod.

*Step 4: Add a PHP frontend to talk to this database*

In this step we will add a PHP frontend application that talks to
recently create database. The code is available on github to use at
https://github.com/rgupta1234/dbtest.

Browse through the code in this repository. It has a simple php file
(`dbtest.php`) that connects to the database and reads the values from
the users table and displays them.

To add a frontend again click on *Add to Project* to spin up a frontend
application in the same *consoleproject-userxx*. It takes you to
select image or template page and choose the *PHP* template under PHP
apps.

Enter the following values for each parameters:

[width="50%",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Git Repository URL
|dbtest   |https://github.com/rgupta1234/dbtest
|=========================================================

Click onto the link "Show advanced routing, build, and deployment
options", go to Deployment Configuration section and enter the following
environment variables:

image::dbtest_deployment_env.jpg[image]

In the next section add a label:

[width="50%",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Value
|name   |dbtest
|=========================================================

Click *Create* to add this frontend application to talk to the database.

image::cakephp_confirm.png[image]

Click *Continue to overview*.

You will be taken back to the *Project Overview* page and you will start
seeing that a new service is now available and exposed as a route.

You can check the build logs using the following command:

----
$ oc logs build/dbtest-1

----

Once the build completes, OpenShift initiates a deploy process. Once the
deployment is complete, the frontend pod starts running. You will find
the running pod when you navigate to *Applications->Pods* on the Web
console.

Now type in your application url in the browser or use curl with:

----
http://[your application url]/dbtest.php
----

You will notice that it displays the records read from the database

----
Hello All.. Here is the list of users:
User Id: 1 User Name: joe
User Id: 2 User Name: alice
End of the list
----

In this lab exercise you have seen a complete web application deployed
using OpenShift templates in two parts. First we deployed the MySQL
database. We added data manually by getting into the pod. Then we added
the frontend code that was built using the OpenShift S2I process. You
configured this frontend application to access the database using a
service, in this case, the "mysql" service. The frontend is made
accessible using a route for which you gave a URL.
